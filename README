This is a small ptyhon script which generates SVG themes for cairo-clock. 
The generated theme looks like the old 90s BBC clock. Generated theme included.

Install:

mkdir -p ~/.cairo-clock/themes
cp -R bbc1 ~/.cairo-clock/themes/

Restart cairo-clock and select theme "bbc1"

If you desire a different colour scheme (eg BBC2 brown/white), just edit the python 
source and regenerate the theme.

Limitations:

Cairo-clock requires the clock hands always centred in the window. That means 
if you want to include the text "BBC1" below the clock, you need to pad the 
theme on all 4 sides, making the actual clock quite small.
